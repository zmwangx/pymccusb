This file will hopefully guide you on using the mcc-bluetooth package
that will interface to Measurement Computing data acquisition devices.
You will need to do pairing manually (once), for example using a applet like
Blueman.  Once pairing is done, the test program will either do
discovery, or the user can supply the baddr as an optional argument.


To connect to  the device:
./test-bth1208LS                         or
./test-bth1208LS XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

where XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is the bluetooth address, for example: 00:06:71:50:E3

To compile the library, you need to add the bluez-libs-devel package.

On Fedora 22:                sudo dnf install bluez-libs-devel bluez-tools
On Raspian/Ubuntu/Debian:    sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev bluez-tools
Other distributions:         You are on your own ....

The package assumes you have the bluez stack installed on your computer.  This should
be standard on most versions of Linux.  You also need the program bt-device which is usually
found in /usr/bin/bt-device.

Now you are ready to compile and install the library.

tar zxvf MCCLIBBTH.1.0.tgz
cd mcc-bluetooth
make
sudo make install
./test-bth1208LS
