  removed IRQF_DISABLED as deprecated.

07-24-2015/17:20 --wjj--
  change filePtr->f_dentry->d_inode to filePtr->f_path.dentry->d_inode

08-12-2009/15:00  --wjj--
  added sub version numbers for 2.6.X for kernel releases in a2dc.c
  modfied device_create to add extra argument
  changed nopage method to fault method

06-16-2008/12:30 --wjj--
   removed asm/page.h from test-das4020

03-28-2008/09:15 --wjj--
  - Moved spin_lock_init() to __init just before pci_register_driver().

09-17-2007/09:00 --wjj--
  - Memory corruption on read() of DIO due to nonBlockFlag getting written to invalid channel. 
  - control byte written to wrong register for soft read. 
  - Incorrect clearing of the busy flag when a DIO read is performed. 

08-27-2007/11:00 --wjj--
  -Let kernel dynamically select major number
  -Register device with /sys/class/das4020-12
  -Include udev rules to create device nodes
  - Change pci_module_init() to pci_register_driver()
    (pci_module_init() doesn't exist on recent kernels)
  - Enable bus mastering in case the BIOS forgot to (otherwise DMA
     doesn't work)
  - Use remap_pfn_range() to ensure that the VM system doesn't try to
    free the DMA pages on munmap(), in parallel with PG_reserved, which is
    ignored starting with kernel 2.6.15. This fixes the kernel panic and
    system crash which otherwise occurs on munmap() or program exit. 
  - Eliminate the nopage() handler, which is unnecessary now that the DMA
    pages are mapped with remap_pfn_range().

Changes in a2dc_2_6.c
  Fixed compiler warnings on return types.  Added ioctl ADC_SET_CLK_SRC
  and ADC_GET_CLK_SRC to implement external clocking.


01-24-2006/19:55 --wjj--
  for a2dc_2_6.c (v2.6 only)
  Changed verify_area() to !access_ok().
  Deleted ADC_ChanRec.gain as information was redundant in ADC_ChanRec.bitmask.
  Fixed bugs and reimplemented analog triggering correctly. Changes
  to load_calibartion_coef, ADC_SET_ATRIG_MODE.  Added defines to pci-das4020.h
  Fixed documentation bug for POSITIVE_HYSTERESIS and NEGATIVE_HYSTERESIS 
  being swapped.
  
01-23-2006/10:09 --wjj--
  Fixed bug in implementation in settingup analog triggering.  Changes to
  ADC_SET_ATRIG_MODE, dma_read() and adc_soft_conversion().
  Fixed nonsense values in ATRIG_CH[0-3].

  Patches from Steve Holland <sdh4@cornell.edu>.  Newer boards lock up
  when performing DMA aborts.  The problem seems to be related to
  disabling the DMA channel while aborting DMA in READY MODE. Fix
  is to not turn off the enable bit.  Also, recent kernel releases
  (post 2.6.11) perform interrupt routing in pci_enable_device(), so
  it must be called before extracting the irq from the pdev structure.

07-23-2004:/10:00 --wjj--
  Rewrote Makefile to conform to new way of kernel building. 
  Updated to support 2.6 kernel.  Added file a2dc_2.6.c

12-10-2003:/12:15 --wjj--
  Implemented true scatter-gather dma.  Added elements to BoardRec and two 
  constants: ADC_BUFF_PHY_SIZE (which can be > 2MB) and ADC_BUFF_PAGE_SIZE.
  Added 2 new ioctl calls;
  ADC_GET_HALF_FIFO_SIZE and ADC_GET_DMA_BUF_SIZE.
    
 11-18-2003/9:30 --wjj--
  Patches from Steve Holland <sdh4@cornell.edu> to fix kernel oops.  removed call to get_page() in
  nopage method, and allocate reserved pages with SetPageReserved().
  remove all references to dma_phy_addr <sdh4@cornell.edu>.

05-07-2003/8:30 --wjj--
  Removed MAX_COUNT and ADC_KernBuff.  Use buffer returned from pci_alloc_consistent.

03-17-2003/11:30 --wjj--
   1. added munmap to test-das4020.c to unmap the dma buffer from user space.
   2. fixed bug in virtual address of nopage method.  added memory size check.
  
03-13-2003/14:00 --wjj--
   remove mmap flag.  Not needed and causes problems with multiple channels.
   Only one call to mmap needed per board.  All channels on the same
   board share the same dam buffer.

11-25-2002/10:30 --wjj--
  1. Added ALIGN_ADDRESS it insure that dma buffers are mapped along PAGE_SIZE addresses.
  2. Using kernel macros u8/u16/u32.
  3. Set default dio control reg to 0x9b.
  4. Improved debug printk information to reflect board.

11-13-2002/   -- Robert Penny --
  test-das4020.c 
  1. Fixed noprint option
  2. Removed double line breaks in useage message
  3. Added command line switch to select different boards

11-13-2002/10:00 --wjj--
  Added support for multiple boards.
  Using PCI hotpluggable interface.

11-08-2002/9:30  --wjj--
  There is a timing problem in soft_conversion when polling HW_STAT_REG.
  I believe that rapid polling of that register prevents the correct bits
  from being set.  Added a small delay to the inner loop.

10-22-2002/10:30 --wjj--
  defined USE_DMA_BUFFER so that driver would work without dma, and checked 
  that memory region was not in use. 
  Fixed bug in loading DAC0 and DAC1.
  Added non-blocking mode per suggestion of Steve Holland <sdh4@cornell.edu>.

09-17-2002/10:10 --wjj--
  Changed && to & to fix bug in BoardData.SampleInterval.
  Fixed bug in switch statement for setting CR1_CHANMODE.

09-06-2002/16:00 --wjj--
   Added module version control to module.  depmod should now work without errors
   at boot time.
